# Frontend Mentor - FAQ Accordion Solution

This repository contains my solution to the [FAQ accordion challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-wyfFdeBwBz). Frontend Mentor challenges are a great way to enhance coding skills by working on practical projects.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript

### Continued Development

I would like to continue developing my skills in responsive design, accessibility, and working with APIs in future projects. Additionally, I aim to explore advanced features of CSS Grid for building complex layouts.
